<h1> VISUALIZATIONS </h1>
<H2>Customer's Age By Gender</H2>
      <p>  Analyzing customer age by gender involves categorizing customers into age groups and examining the proportion of males and females within each group. This helps identify demographic trends and preferences, such as younger age groups possibly having a higher percentage of female customers interested in fashion, while older age groups may show more balanced gender distributions with diverse interests. Understanding these patterns allows businesses to tailor marketing strategies and product offerings to better serve different segments of their customer base.</p>

<h2>Order Quantity By Month</h2>
         <p> Analyzing order quantity by month involves examining the number of orders placed each month to identify seasonal trends and patterns. This analysis helps businesses understand peak periods of demand, such as increased orders during holiday seasons or sales events, and lower activity during off-peak months. By understanding these fluctuations, businesses can better manage inventory, staffing, and marketing efforts to align with customer purchasing behaviors throughout the year.</p>
