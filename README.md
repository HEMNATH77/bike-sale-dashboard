This helps identify demographic trends and preferences, such as younger age groups possibly having a higher percentage of female customers interested in fashion, while older age groups may show more balanced gender distributions with diverse interests. Understanding these patterns allows businesses to tailor marketing strategies and product offerings to better serve different segments of their customer base.</p>
